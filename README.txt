Recreation of a fun game.
--------------------------

Hey, this is a reacreation of a game that I enjoy called age of war.
I'm trying to replicate it using a small template, but the rest is made
from the ground up. Somethings are not always perfect so I need some help
with it.
------------------------
Goal of game: Reach the other side and kill the others base with your own
troops.
--------------------------
Current problem: When two enemies come into contact they battle and on is killed,
once that happens the winner stands still.
